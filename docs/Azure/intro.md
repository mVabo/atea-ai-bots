## Define an AI technology strategy

An AI technology strategy involves selecting the right tools and platforms for your generative and nongenerative AI use cases. You need to pick AI solutions that align with your skill set, data readiness, and budget. Microsoft has a variety of AI solutions to align with different needs. There are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) options. The service model you choose affects the AI shared responsibility between you and Microsoft.

Use the following AI decision tree to narrow down options for each AI use case. Review all the options before making your initial decision. When you identify an AI service, confirm that the service is a good fit. Use the following guidance to validate the skills needed, data needed, and cost factors to ensure success.
