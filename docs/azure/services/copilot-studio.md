# Copilot Studio

Copilot Studio is a graphical, low-code tool for both creating an agent—including building automation with Power Automate—and extending a Microsoft 365 Copilot with your own enterprise data and scenarios.

One of the standout features of Copilot Studio is its ability to connect to other data sources using either prebuilt or custom plugins. This flexibility enables users to create and orchestrate sophisticated logic, ensuring that their agent experiences are both powerful and intuitive.

The platform's low-code experience puts the power of AI at the user's fingertips, making it accessible even to people without extensive technical backgrounds.

## What is an agent?

An agent is a powerful AI companion that can handle a range of interactions and tasks, from resolving issues requiring complex conversations to autonomously determining the best action to take based on its instructions and context. Agents coordinate a collection of language models, along with instructions, context, knowledge sources, topics, actions, inputs, and triggers to accomplish your desired goals.

Agents can engage with customers and employees in multiple languages across websites, mobile apps, Facebook, Microsoft Teams, or any channel supported by the Azure Bot Service. They can also improve productivity by performing tasks to assist users and organizations.

You can easily create agents in Copilot Studio without the need for data scientists or developers. Some of the ways you might use agents include:

- Sales help and support issues.
- Opening hours and store information.
- Employee health and vacation benefits.
- Public health tracking information.
- Common employee questions for businesses.
